	abstract = {Application of CDR is a widely discussed topic currently. A lot of research projects are making use of CDR and the first companies bringing CDR analysis to the market are emerging. However especially for the transport sector there are some obstacles to overcome. This paper gives a comprehensive overview on what is going on in research and the next steps to be make CDR widely available.},

 abstract = {Traveling beyond the immediate surroundings of one’s residence can lead to greater exposure to new ideas and information, jobs, and greater transmission of disease. In this paper, we document the geographic mobility of individuals in the U.S., and how this mobility varies across U.S. cities, regions, and income classes. Using geolocation data for ~1.7 million smartphone users over a 10-month period, we compute different measures of mobility, including the total distance traveled, the median daily distance traveled, the maximum distance traveled from one’s home, and the number of unique haunts visited. We find large differences across cities and income groups. For example, people in New York travel 38% fewer total kilometers and visit 14% fewer block-sized areas than people in Atlanta. And, individuals in the bottom income quartile travel 12% less overall and visit 13% fewer total locations than the top income quartile.},
